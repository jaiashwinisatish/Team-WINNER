# Phase 2 Plan 4: Document renamed UI components and clean README/Hints

## Objective

Address COMP-14 (renamed UI components) by ensuring import paths consistently resolve, and fix the Rick Roll content in README.md and Hints/runthis.sh.

## Context

**Renamed UI component file mapping (discovered during Phase 2 research):**
- `ali.tsx` → Badge component (exports `Badge`, `badgeVariants`) — but no `export` statement!
- `barnbeer.tsx` → Menubar component (exports `Menubar`, etc.)
- `doctor.tsx` → Avatar component (exports `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, `AvatarFallback`)
- `expandible.tsx` → Checkbox component (exports `Checkbox`)
- `hello.tsx` → Progress component (exports `Progress`)
- `lol.tsx` → RadioGroup component (exports `RadioGroup`, `RadioGroupItem`)
- `mohammad.tsx` → Button component (exports `Button`, `buttonVariants`)
- `output.tsx` → Input component (exports `Input`)
- `poppy.tsx` → Popover component (exports `Popover`, `PopoverTrigger`, `PopoverContent`)
- `router.tsx` → Switch component (exports `Switch`) — BUT also has corrupted code (SelectLabel mixed in)

**File content swaps (saboteur also swapped file contents):**
- `card.tsx` contains Chart component code (recharts)
- `chart.tsx` contains Card component code
- `badge.tsx` contains Calendar component code (with orphan `export { Badge, badgeVariants }` at top referencing `ali.tsx` content)

**Approach:** Since these files are used internally and the primary consumer is `chat-message.tsx`, we'll ensure chat-message imports resolve correctly (already handled in Plan 3) and document the mapping. We won't rename files to avoid breaking any other imports throughout the codebase — the core chat UI just needs to work.

## Tasks

### Document renamed components — COMP-14

**Requirements:** COMP-14

**What to do:**
The renamed files are functional — they export the correct components, just from wrong filenames. The key issue is that import paths need to reference the actual filenames. Since `chat-message.tsx` (the only consumer in the main flow) has been fixed in Plan 3 to use the correct paths (`@/components/ui/doctor` for Avatar, `@/components/ui/chart` for Card), this requirement is satisfied.

For belt-and-suspenders, verify no other files in `src/` import from the "expected" filenames that don't exist (e.g., `@/components/ui/button` should map to `mohammad.tsx`):

```bash
grep -r "ui/button" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
grep -r "ui/avatar" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
grep -r "ui/input" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
grep -r "ui/badge" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
```

If any file imports `@/components/ui/button`, fix it to `@/components/ui/mohammad`. Similarly for other renamed components.

**Special case — `badge.tsx`:**
The file `badge.tsx` starts with `export { Badge, badgeVariants }` but those symbols are defined in `ali.tsx`. Also, `badge.tsx` actually contains the Calendar component. The orphan export at line 1-2 of `badge.tsx` will cause a runtime error since `Badge`/`badgeVariants` aren't defined in that file. We should remove lines 1-2 of `badge.tsx`.

**Special case — `router.tsx`:**
This file has corrupted code — the Switch component is mixed with SelectLabel code from select.tsx. Fix by removing the SelectLabel code and properly closing the Switch component.

**Done criteria:**
- All import paths resolve correctly (no "module not found" errors for UI components)
- `badge.tsx` doesn't have orphan exports
- `router.tsx` has clean Switch component code

### Fix README.md — DATA-02

**Requirements:** DATA-02

**What to do:**
Replace the Rick Roll content in README.md with actual project documentation:

```markdown
# WikiAgent

AI-Powered Wikipedia Assistant built with Next.js, Genkit AI, and the Wikipedia API.

## Features

- **Question Input**: Ask any question in a simple chat interface
- **AI Agent Answering**: Genkit AI generates factual answers based on Wikipedia content
- **Source Linking**: See the Wikipedia articles used to generate each answer
- **Chat Interface**: Scroll through your conversation history

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **AI Backend**: Genkit AI with Google Gemini
- **Data Source**: Wikipedia API
```

**Done criteria:**
- README contains actual project setup instructions
- No Rick Roll content
</task>

<task id="3" type="auto">
### Remove Hints/runthis.sh — DATA-03

**Requirements:** DATA-03

**What to do:**
Replace the Rick Roll script with an actual hints file:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# WikiAgent — Development Hints
#
# Quick start:
#   npm install
#   npm run dev
#
# The app runs at http://localhost:3000
#
# Project structure:
#   src/app/         — Next.js pages and layouts
#   src/components/  — React components (UI + wiki-agent)
#   src/ai/          — Genkit AI flows and configuration
#   src/lib/         — Utility functions
#   src/hooks/       — Custom React hooks

echo "WikiAgent Development Hints"
echo "=========================="
echo ""
echo "1. Run 'npm install' to install dependencies"
echo "2. Run 'npm run dev' to start the dev server"
echo "3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser"
echo ""
echo "Project structure:"
echo "  src/app/         — Next.js pages and layouts"
echo "  src/components/  — React components"
echo "  src/ai/          — Genkit AI flows"
echo "  src/lib/         — Utility functions"
```

**Done criteria:**
- No Rick Roll content
- File provides actual helpful hints about the project
</task>

## Verification

```bash
# Check no broken imports
grep -rn "from.*ui/button" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v "mohammad"
grep -rn "from.*ui/avatar" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v "doctor"
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Renamed UI component imports resolve correctly for all consumers
- [ ] `badge.tsx` orphan exports removed
- [ ] `router.tsx` cleaned of corrupted SelectLabel code
- [ ] README.md has real project docs
- [ ] Hints/runthis.sh has real hints
