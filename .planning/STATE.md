## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in REQUIREMENTS.md.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 2026-02-28: Organized 120 bugs into 3 sequential phases (Config → UI → AI)
- 2026-02-28: Hooks and utilities grouped with Phase 1 (build must work first)
- 2026-02-28: DATA-01 assigned to Phase 1, DATA-02/03 to Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Three core component files (`page.tsx`, `chat-container.tsx`, `tooltip.tsx`) are entirely wiped — will need reconstruction from blueprint in Phase 2
- `wikipediaAnswerPrompt` is referenced but never defined — Phase 3 will need to create it from scratch
